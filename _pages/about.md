A results-driven Data Analyst with over nine years of experience transforming complex information into clear, actionable insights. My work spans data cleaning, statistical analysis, visualization, and end-to-end solution development across government, social impact, and technology projects.

Proficient in Python, R, Power BI, Tableau, and SQL, I enjoy bridging the gap between raw data and strategic decision-making.

Beyond analytics, I have a strong foundation in programming, databases, and full-stack web technologies, enabling me to build tools as well as interpret the data they generate. Iâ€™m passionate about learning, problem-solving, and creating solutions that make a measurable difference.
